I've been fascinated by virtualisation from the first time I booted a VM and seen the BIOS appear.

I work with various VMware Datacenter Virtualization technologies all day long as well as some AWS.

### More Information

I have VMware Certifified Implementation Expert 6 - Data Center Virtualization (VCIX6-DCV).

I first became VMware certified by achieving VCP5-DCV back in July 2013.
