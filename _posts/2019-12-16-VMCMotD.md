VMware Cloud on AWS relieves the VI Admin of a lot of the heavy lifting needed to setup and maintain a VMware SDDC.

However once you are running more than a couple of VMC SDDCs the vCenter naming can be confusing.

Each vCenter is named in a pattern like this

vcenter.sddc-13-35-147-83.vmwarevmc.com

Where 13.35.147.83 is an public IP associated with your SDDC.

When logged in the vSphere Client I find it hard to map the vCenter name to the SDDC purpose.

Is this my Sandbox environment or Production? Don't want to get the two mixed up!

The solution I hit upon was to set the vCenter Message of the Day to the SDDC name.

![MotD]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/VMCMotD/MotD.png)
![Set the MotD]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/VMCMotD/SetMotD.png)

Now I can quickly tell what SDDC I'm logged into.

![This SDDC]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/VMCMotD/ThisSDDC.png)

The only negative with this tip is that it's not possible to set the Message of the Day via automation, so it's a manual task whenever an SDDC is created.
